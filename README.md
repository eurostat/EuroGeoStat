# EuroGeoStat

[EuroGeoStat](https://github.com/eurostat/EuroGeoStat) is a Java software library for the manipulation of geographical and statistical data, with a focus on European data produced by [Eurostat](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat).

EuroGeoStat library currently allows:
- Automatic production statistical maps (with a focus on maps based on Eurostat data and NUTS regions).
- Various analyses based on NUTS regions and NUTS codes.
- Some experiments on the combined use of geographical and statistical data such as
  - Statistical data disaggregation based on [dasymetric mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasymetric_map).
  - The computation of the intersection matrix between two statistical units datasets.

(TODO describe)

[EuroGeoStat](https://github.com/eurostat/EuroGeoStat) is mainly based on [GeoTools](http://www.geotools.org/) and [java4eurostat](https://github.com/eurostat/java4eurostat) libraries.

## Quickstart
